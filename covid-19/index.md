# COVID-19 data analysis and forecasting at McMaster University

Our research group is led by three faculty who have been engaged in epidemiological modelling research for more then 20 years:
- [Ben Bolker](https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/)
- [Jonathan Dushoff](https://mac-theobio.github.io/dushoff.html)
- [David Earn](http://davidearn.mcmaster.ca)

## Canadian public data repository

Postdoctoral fellow [Michael Li](https://wzmli.github.io/) is working hard to maintain the most complete, clean, Canadian COVID-19 data set derived from public sources: <https://wzmli.github.io/COVID19-Canada/>

## Advice to governments

We are providing comments and modelling results to several government organizations that have sought our help.

## Software tools

### `McMasterPandemic` R package

[McMasterPandemic](https://github.com/bbolker/McMasterPandemic) is an R package that provides tools for parameter estimation, simulation, and forecasting infectious disease outbreaks (using compartmental epidemic models).  Follow the link to learn more about the package, including how to install and use it.  The functionality of this package is evolving rapidly.  We will improve the documentation as time permits.

### `epigrowthfit` R package

[epigrowthfit](https://github.com/davidearn/epigrowthfit) is an R package for estimating epidemic growth rates.  It was developed for the purpose of studying growth rates of historical epidemics, but it can be used to study real-time outbreaks.  The methodology and philosophy are based on:

Ma J, Dushoff J, Bolker BM, Earn DJD (2014). **_Bulletin of Mathematical Biology_**, <ins>76</ins>(1), 245–260, 
[Estimating initial epidemic growth rates](https://davidearn.mcmaster.ca/publications/MaEtAl2014).

The package is [available freely on github](https://github.com/davidearn/epigrowthfit).  We will improve the documentation as time permits.

## Outreach

We administer [the COVID-19 awareness study](https://www.covid19-awareness.com/): take the survey at the study site, or [through this direct link](https://surveys.mcmaster.ca/limesurvey/index.php/693494).
