title: Post-doctoral opportunities at McMaster University
---

_Posted 15 February 2022_

[The Theoretical Biology Lab at McMaster University](https://mac-theobio.github.io/index.html) has postdoctoral positions available in infectious disease epidemiology.  We are engaged in a broad range of projects and are interested in individuals who are enthusiastic about contributing to epidemiological modelling research and have a high level of skill and experience in one or more of the following areas:

- mathematical and computational modelling of epidemics
- statistical modeling of dynamical systems
- data science
- R programming
- software engineering

Some of our projects are strongly linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, while others relate to other infectious diseases, including historical epidemics in Europe and North America, seasonal and pandemic influenza around the world, and rabies in Africa.

Some positions might involve a limited amount of undergraduate teaching in mathematics, statistics, data science, or computer programming.  Candidates who would like to gain teaching experience should indicate the types of courses they would like to have the opportunity to teach.

One fellowship is available immediately, and others are available at later starting dates.  The initial term is two years, subject to satisfactory performance in the first year.

Review of applications will begin on 15 March 2022, but applications will be considered at any time.

Selected candidates will be expected to start working remotely, but may be asked to move to Hamilton and work in person. Preference will be given to people with permission to work in Canada.

Please submit your application to MathJobs [here](https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/McMaster). Applicants should provide at least three letters of recommendation. At least one of these letters should report on the candidate's teaching abilities. Preferably these letters will be submitted through the MathJobs website; they may also be emailed directly to [us](mailto:bbolker+covidpostdoc@gmail.com). We appreciate all replies to this advertisement, but only applicants under consideration will be contacted.
