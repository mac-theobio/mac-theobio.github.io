__NOTOC__

'''Our lab is interested in theoretical, statistical and computational approaches to understanding the evolution and spread of disease. We embrace a multidisciplinary approach to problems, employing microbiological research, behavioural and social science, network analysis, mathematical modelling, computer simulations and theoretical frameworks.   Research interests range from infectious pathogens such as HIV, malaria and influenza, to obesity and diabetes, to pathogen evolution and gene transfer. Research areas include:'''

* Dynamical and statistical models of disease transmission, risk, and intervention
* Social networks as the route of transmission of information and infections
* The spread of behaviours associated with disease spread
* Metagenomic investigations of microbial ecosystems
