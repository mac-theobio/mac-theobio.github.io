# Post-doctoral opportunity at Simon Fraser University or McMaster University

[Caroline Colijn (SFU)](https://www.sfu.ca/math/people/faculty/ccolijn/) and [David Earn (McMaster)](https://davidearn.mcmaster.ca/) are seeking a postdoctoral researcher to join an interdisciplinary team working on Living Evidence Synthesis (LES) to support mathematical modelling of transmission dynamics of evolving pathogens.  We are interested in individuals who have experience with mechanistic epidemiological modelling and are keen to interact with LES experts and statisticians to improve model parameterization and forecasting.

The ideal candidate will have a high level of skill and experience in several of the following areas:

- mathematical and computational modelling of epidemics
- statistical inference (e.g. parameter estimation)
- R programming
- systematic review and meta-analysis

The initial focus of the position will be on COVID-19, but other infectious diseases will also be considered. The post-holder will be encouraged and supported in developing their own research program in collaboration with local, national and international collaborators and partners including public health agencies and researchers, and will have the opportunity to travel to conferences and suggest invited speakers. Projects can be tailored to suit the candidate’s research interests and expertise.

You will be joining a multidisciplinary group of infectious disease modellers and biomathematicians with a broad range of interests across mathematics, statistics and biology. Specific ongoing projects include: modelling the interplay between interventions (vaccination, antibiotic treatment) and pathogen diversification, quantifying selection and evolution in pathogen populations, developing statistical methods for estimating epidemiological parameters in infectious disease. Regardless of which of the two institutions where you are formally based, you will have the opportunity to interact with both the [MAGPIE research group at SFU](https://mac-theobio.github.io/) and the [Theobio lab at McMaster](https://mac-theobio.github.io/).

The fellowship is available immediately, but the start date is negotiable. The initial term is one year, with the potential for renewal subject to satisfactory performance and continued funding.

Review of applications will begin on 16 May 2022, but applications will be considered until the position is filled.  Selected candidates can choose to be associated officially either with Simon Fraser University in British Columbia or McMaster University in Ontario, but can work remotely if desired in any case.  Preference will be given to people with permission to work in Canada.

Please submit your application to MathJobs (at [https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/fellowship/19945](https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/fellowship/19945)), including a CV and research statement. Applicants should provide at least three letters of recommendation.  Preferably these letters will be submitted through the MathJobs website; they may also be emailed directly to [Caroline Colijn and David Earn](mailto:Caroline Colijn <ccolijn@sfu.ca>, David Earn <earn@math.mcmaster.ca>).
