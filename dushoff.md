## Research

I am a theoretical biologist with a broad interest in computational and statistical approaches to practical biological questions with a particular interest in dynamical questions (how systems are shaped at large scales by the way that they change at small scales). My current research is mostly focused on infectious diseases of humans.

## Post-doctoral fellows

I am currently looking post-docs to study the spread of rabies. [Application information](jd/rabies_pdf.html) is here.

## Graduate studies

I accept graduate students via:

* The [Department of Biology](http://www.biology.mcmaster.ca/)
* The [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/)
* The [School of Computational Science and Engineering](http://computational.mcmaster.ca/graduate-studies.html)

## Undergraduate studies

As a theorist, I do _not_ have volunteer or research assistant positions suitable for undergraduates.

I _do_ supervise [undergraduate projects](jd/undergrad.html).
