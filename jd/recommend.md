title: JD recommendations
---

I dislike writing recommendations for people I don't know well.
Unfortunately, some schools and programs require recommendation letters
specifically from university professors (or specifically from science
professors). This is stupid, and I am willing to accept that it's not
your fault. On the other hand, it's not my fault either.

If I was your supervisor, or co-supervisor, or you took a graduate or
seminar course with me, this page does not apply to you.

Documentation
=============

You must provide documentation that the application has specific
requirements for recommenders (typically this means only university
professors, or only university science professors). I will not recommend
you for a position for which the requirements seem reasonable (eg., a
research fellowship), but will recommend you for any position where I
agree that it doesn't make sense that you need a personal recommendation
from a university professor: this includes professional schools or
teaching fellowships.

Please let me know what classes you've taken with me (and in what
years), whether we've interacted, and what grades you have gotten.

Unless you have a common given name, which is commonly associated with
the gender you identify with, please also let me know if I should use
male or female pronouns in your letter.

Known offenders
---------------

If the place you want me to send the recommendation is listed [
here](/jd/offenders.html), you can
send this link as documentation for the recommenders' requirements.

Recommendation
==============

You should not expect me to give you a glowing recommendation, or to
read your resume and translate it for the institution. I will say
something like, "as far as I know, XX is a good, responsible student and
will make a good law student". I will absolutely not say anything
negative in the letter. In the unlikely event that I have something
against you (and remember), I will instead decline to write the
recommendation.

If you have a good grade (10 or above) in *a course that I co-ordinate*
(e.g., 3SS, but not 1M), I will also write something about how the
course emphasizes conceptual knowledge and logical thinking, and that
the grade therefore reflects well on you.

Forms
-----

I will be very resistant to signing form letters for people I don't know
well. You must provide documentation that the form letter is absolutely
required (and must be from a professor), and even then I may resist,
depending on what I am being asked to sign.

I will absolutely not fill out charts or provide numerical rankings for
people I don't know well; you will need to ask the institution if they
accept a letter only, or else recommendation forms where I explain why I
haven't filled out some of the sections (they should).

Request
=======

If you would like to be recommended under these terms, please [send me by
email](mailto:dushoff@mcmaster.ca):

-   your name, course(s) taken with me, grade(s) received
-   confirmation that you require a letter from a professor
-   instructions about how to fill out the recommendation, and if
    necessary what I must do *instead* of filling out scoring forms or
    signing form letters; you should include deadline information in
    your email

if you would like me to use snail mail, you should also bring
an *addressed* biology department envelope (obtainable from the biology
department office on the second floor of LSB); you do not need to add a
stamp.
