The McMaster [#theobio group](../) is looking for one or two postdoctoral researchers to analyze and model infectious disease data. The successful candidate will be based at McMaster University, in the group of Dr. Jonathan Dushoff (Department of Biology). The postdoc will join a diverse team and work to analyze data about rabies spread in endemic areas of Asia and Africa, to help pursue the goal of ending canine rabies as a public-health threat. The position is for one year, and can be renewed for a second.

The successful candidate will have strong quantitative, computational and communication skills. Applicants should have experience with dynamical modeling of ecological or infectious disease systems and parameter estimation for statistical models (Bayesian or frequentist). 

Review of applications will begin on 1 Feb 2023, and continue until the position is filled. To apply, please e-mail Jonathan Dushoff (dushoff@mcmaster.ca) with a curriculum vitae (CV), a one-page statement of how your research interests and experience relate to this position, and contact information for 3 references.

Please indicate when you are available to start. The target date is the second half of 2023. 

McMaster is located in Hamilton, Ontario, less than an hour from both Niagara Falls and from Toronto (and convenient to the latter by public transportation). The campus is large, green and conveniently located.
