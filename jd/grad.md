title: Graduate and post-graduate opportunities
---

I am always interested in talented, motivated and quantitatively oriented prospective trainees interested in theoretical biology, particularly (but not exclusively) in the evolution and spread of infectious diseases of humans.

It is usually best to apply informally, either before or in parallel with the regular application process. To do this, please [email](mailto:dushoff@mcmaster.ca):

* A brief (500-600 words) description of
	* your general research interests;
	* some specific thoughts about what sort of project you would be interested in working on in our lab -- this could be a topic, or an approach, and can be specific or general;
	* a few words about the overlap between your research interests and ours -- in other words, a brief explanation of why my group would be a good place for you to conduct your research.
* A one- or two-paragraph description of your background and skills: e.g., what sorts of math, statistics, biology and computation courses and experience you have; have you done any research projects or other projects of interest?  
* _Optional_: You may also want to send a CV.
