We are working on a variety of exciting projects with public-health agencies around the world (some shown [here](covid-19/)), and have funding from the Public Health Agency of Canada and other sources for a postdoc to work on practical questions related to understanding and managing the spread of COVID-19. The ideal candidate would have expertise in epidemiological modeling, statistical modeling of dynamical systems, and R programming. 

The term is one year, renewable if funding is renewed successfully. You must be willing to commit to a period of at least six months, and be able to start working soon.
