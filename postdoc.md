__DRAFT__: Do not find this page until we post a link.

[We](index.html) are looking for someone who can start a COVID-related postdoc in the very near future. We are working on a variety of exciting projects with public-health agencies around the world (some shown [here](covid-19/)), and have funding from the Public Health Agency of Canada and other sources for a postdoc to work on practical questions related to understanding and managing the spread of COVID-19. The ideal candidate would have expertise in epidemiological modeling, statistical modeling of dynamical systems, and R programming. Please contact us if you're interested or know someone who might be. 

The term is one year, renewable if funding is renewed successfully. You must be willing to commit to a period of at least six months, and be able to start working soon.

You will be expected to start working remotely, but may be asked to move to Hamilton and work in person if your term is renewed. Preference will be given to people with permission to work in Canada.
